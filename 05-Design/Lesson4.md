# Web Design vs Development.

-   Web Designers create the overall look and feel of a website
-   Web developers implement the design using HTML, CSS and Javascript code

## Good Design vs Bad Design

**Good Design**

-   Creates an immediate and lasting good impression of the brand or product.
-   Makes the user trust the brand right away.
-   Increases the user’s perceived value of the brand or product.
-   Gives users exactly what they were looking for when coming to the site, e.g. purchasing a product or finding information.

**Bad Design**

-   Makes users believe the brand doesn’t really care about their product or service.
-   Makes the user insecure about trusting the brand.
-   Makes the brand or product seem “cheap”.
-   Leaves users confused, and makes it hard to for them to reach their goal.

**Typography**

-   Use guideline in the resources folder
-   Font weight, don't go below 400(preferably choose: 400, 500 and 700)
-   for font-family: "Inter", sans-serif; If there is no internet connection, you wont be able to load Inter from google fonts, so you will use sans-serif.
-   Use https://typescale.com/ for font-size system.

**Colors**

-   Use a tool to choose your color pallet
-   The main color is always used on Buttons
-   Use open color to choose the right colors according to the images
-   Always check the contrast between background color and the text (Accessibility rule): Use Coolors tool, contrast checker.

**Images**

-   Besides Text, Images are the most important components of a website.
-   Get free images or illustrations from unsplash
-   Compress your images using Squoosh tool.

**Icons**

-   Icons can change a lot of details on the webpages
-   The most common use of icons, is to create feature blocks.
-   To use the icons, simply copy the svg code and paste it in your file.
-   To define the icon color, you use the _stroke/fill_ property

**Shadows**

-   We can use shadows to add interesting visual details
-   To add shadows in css always use the _box-shadow_ property.
-   E.g box-shadow: 0 20px 30px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.07); (horizontal offset) (vertical offset) blur (scaling up the shadow) color;
-   For text shadow: text-shadow: 0 5px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2); Text Shadow is useful where you have text on top of an image.

**Border Radius**

-   Choose a border radius according to the typeface.
-   Use border radius simply to take away the hard edges on buttons, images, icons, sections etc
-   To specify border radius; use the _border-radius_ property.

**White Space**

-   White space is space between elements
-   The right amount makes the page look more clean, modern and polished.

**Visual Hierarchy**

-   Visual hierarchy is all about establishing which elements of the design are the most important
-   To draw more attention to a component/section/part in a website, use a combination of position, color, shadows etc
