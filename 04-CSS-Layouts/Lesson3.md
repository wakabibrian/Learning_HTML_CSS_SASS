# Lesson 3: Layouts: Floats, Flexbox and CSS Grid

Layout is the way text, images and other content are placed and arranged on a webpage (instead of having them one after another; normal flow)
Layout gives the page a visual structure and into the structure we place the content

## Types of layouts

-   Page Layout: Laying out elements (big pieces - components) inside of a web page
-   Component Layout: Laying out smaller components inside of the big pieces (components)

## 3 Ways of Building Layouts

1. Float Layouts (old way of building layouts) - using the float css property
2. Flexbox (one of the modern ways of building layouts) - Its perfect for building one dimensional layouts (a layout with just a row) - Perfect for component layouts
3. CSS Grid (one of the modern ways of building layouts) - For laying out elements in 2-dimensional grid. Perfect for page layouts and complex components
