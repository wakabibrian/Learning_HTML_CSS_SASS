## Inline, Internal and External CSS

There are 3 places where we write our css;

-   Inline CSS
-   Internal CSS
-   External CSS

### Inline CSS

This is a way of writing the CSS inside of the elements using the style attribute

-   Inline styles should never be used (No separation of concerns)

### Internal CSS

This is a way of writing the CSS inside the head ealement, using the style element

-   This is incase of alot of CSS code (No separation of CSS code from HTML)

### External CSS

Most prefered

-   You use a separate css file (eg. style.css)
-   We link the css file to html using the _link_ element, in the head element
-   The link tag has the rel, and href properties (attributies)
    -   rel property specifies that it's a stylesheet
    -   href property specifies the path
