- some elements without content like img have no closing tags
- Web browsers understand HTML and render HTML code as websites

## Basic HTML Document Structure

- Each html document has the following structure:

1. Doctype - html: Tells the browser that the document is html - uses html 5 specification to render the page (No closing tag)
2. html element: Each html page must start with html element (Which is the parent element of the head and body elements) (has closing tag)
3. head element: This is for elements that are not visible/not rendered in the browswer window.
   Examples of head elements:
   - title: title of the web page (has closing tag)
4. body element: This contains all the elements that are visible on the web page.
   Examples of body elements:
   - h1: level 1 of the heading of text (has closing tag)
     Other levels include; h2, h3, h4, h5, h6
